# What is dynamic inventory
# ----------------------------
# insted of getting ip address statically we can pull the ip address dynamically using aws ansible dynamic inventory plugin.
# we will provide, all the required parameter in yaml file and insted of static inventory  file we will give this dynamic invertory plugin to ansible playbook it will fetch the ip-addresses and it will execute.

# ansible can connect to aws dynamically to fetch the ip address using dynamic inventory plugin(amazon.aws.aws_ec2), this helps in autoscaling kind of environment ,where fetching the IP address statically is not possible.

# plugin: connects to other system and fetch required information
